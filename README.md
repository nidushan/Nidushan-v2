# Jan — Minimal Personal Site

A small, responsive, lightweight static site to showcase Jan (nidushan).

What this includes
- `index.html` — single page site (About / Projects / Contact)
- `styles.css` — responsive, accessible styling (dark navy + gold accent)
- `script.js` — tiny JS for mobile nav toggle
- `LarsJ.png` — your logo (replace with your own file)

Quick setup
1. Put these files plus `LarsJ.png` in the same folder.
2. Open `index.html` locally to preview.
3. Deploy to any static host (GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, S3, etc.)

Customizations
- Replace `LarsJ.png` with your logo (same filename) for immediate use.
- Edit the "Selected projects" section to feature other repos or remove/extend cards.
- Add an email contact link or a small contact form if you want direct outreach.
- If you prefer a lighter theme, adjust CSS variables in `styles.css` (`--bg`, `--accent`, etc.)

Notes
- Links point to your public GitHub profile and LinkedIn; if you want server-side or dynamic features I can add a contact form or CMS integration.
- Kept dependencies to zero for speed and simplicity.

If you'd like, I can:
- Produce a version as a single-file HTML (inline CSS/JS) for maximum portability.
- Add a downloadable vCard, resume link, or an animated intro.
- Convert to a small static site generator template (11ty / Hugo) for easier content maintenance.
